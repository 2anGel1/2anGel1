# Hi there, this is Ange Emmanuel ASSAMOI aka @scopy 👋

I'm a self-taught dev who loves to build, break, and learn.
Most driven by curiosity and that thrill of turning random ideas into something real, i love coding and 
is for me, half craft, half playground — and there’s always something new to try next.
