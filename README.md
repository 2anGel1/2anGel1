# Hi there, this is Ange Emmanuel ASSAMOI aka @scopy ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught dev who loves to build, break, and learn.
Most driven by curiosity and that thrill of turning random ideas into something real, i love coding and 
is for me, half craft, half playground â€” and thereâ€™s always something new to try next.
